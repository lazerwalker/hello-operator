<h1>Hello Operator</h1>

<h2>Controller and Gameplay</h2>

<p><em>Hello Operator</em> is a fairly straight-forward time management game, a la <em>Tapper</em> or <em>Diner Dash</em>, except it's completely physical, with no screen or traditional input.</p>

<p>Gameplay is based on the actual act of using a telephone switchboard as an operator. The steps to make a single call are pretty simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When a customer's indicator light turns on, plug a cable into their port and flip the cable's corresponding operator switch to open a connection to them.</li>
  <li>Once you've picked up the attached telephone handset and they've told you who they want to speak with, flip the switch back and connect the matching cable to the recipient's port.</li>
  <li>When both callers' indicator lights start flashing, they're ready to be disconnected.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's easy enough to do, but things get very complicated very quickly as the number of customers ready to make phone calls increases.</p>

<p>The actual hardware – made of wood, ABS plastic, acryllic, metal switches and plugs, and a vintage telephone – is being designed and built as the final project for a course on hardware fabrication as part of my research at the MIT Media Lab. It's due to be completed by December 15, at which point I'll update this site with accurate photos and information. Here is a photo of the CAD file that will be used for the main machine.</p>

<p>It's designed to be a standalone object – think roughly the physical footprint of a standard arcade cabinet, but not as tall – and has been designed to be modular for transport (to, say, San Francisco for alt.ctrl.GDC).</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the game exists in the form of both cardboard and digital prototypes. The cardboard prototype is running the same code that the final hardware will be running (minus some few minor details related to differences between my Arduino-based prototype and the microcontroller being used in the PCBs I'm fabricating myself for the final version).</p>

<h2>Concepts for Final Design</h2>

<p>Once the hardware itself gets built, I don't anticipate any major changees or improvements before GDC. It's possible the specific steps for any individual phone call may change, or the total number of possible "customes", based on after I can do tuning and playtesting with the actual final hardware.</p>

<p>Once this is all done, I plan on experimenting with using the hardware and concept for narrative purposes, letting you flip a switch as the operator to listen in on people's conversations, and crafting a game and narrative around that surveillance mechanic. It's highly unlikely this is something that will be polished and ready to be deployed by the time GDC rolls around, though.</p>
